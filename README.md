Implemented the KeyListener interface for streamlined user controls and the AWT/Swing graphics packages. Improved game by refining collision detection algorithms and other aspects of the physics engine.

Instructions:
1) Download all .java files to the same directory
2) Run GamePlay.java

Gameplay:
1) Bounce the ball off the paddle in order to destroy the bricks. 
2) Move the paddle using the left and right arrow keys. If the ball falls past your paddle, you lose a life. 
3) You have 7 lives to complete 5 levels. 
4) Different bricks take different number of hits to destroy: red = 1, orange = 2, green = 3, gray = 5.
